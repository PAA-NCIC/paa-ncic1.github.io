          <p>I am a PhD student at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences since 2010. My supervisor is Professor Ninghui Sun, and currently I do research on large-scale graph computing in Prof. Guangming Tan's team. Previously, I was a member of ACSA group at University of Science and Technology of China, where I finished the MS degree in 2010 under supervision of Prof. Hong An. Earlier, I got my BS degree of computer science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunication in 2007.</p>
          <p>My research interests are parallel algorithms and system design.</p>
          <p>I am going to graduate in July 2014, and currently looking for a job. You can find my resume <a href="resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>

            <h3><a href="../index.html"></a>GRE (<a href="../index.html">Graph Runtime Engine</a>)</h3>
            <div class="date">September 2010 - Present</div>
            <p>GRE is a platform for emerging large-scale distributed graph-parallel computation on real-world graphs with over billions of vertices and edges. Essentials of GRE are our new proposed abstractions on both computation model and distributed graph model, as well as an efficient underlying runtime highly optimized for both multi-core and network communication. It runs 2.5-17X faster than PowerGraph (GraphLab 2.2) for applications such as PageRank and Single Source Shortest Path.

            <h3>Sweep-H</h3>
            <div class="date">March 2011 - July 2011</div>
            <p>Sweep-H is a framework for hybrid parallel Sn Sweeps on large-scale unstructured grids. Sweep-H solves the Sn Sweep problem in a way of data-driven traversal on directed acyclic graphs. Experiments with real-world grids on a cluster with 64 machines (768 cores) demonstrate Sweep-H's near linear scalability and significant performance advantage over traditional designs.

            <h3>SMART</h3>
            <div class="date">September 2008 - April 2010</div>
            <p>SMART, the Sampling, Monitoring, Analyzing, and ReTuning, is a tool suite for multi-threading parallel programs. It was part of National Projects for 'nucleus electronic components, high-end general processors, and fundamental software'. I proposed the software architecture with my supervisor, and developed the Linux kernel extension (its design is similar to today's perf) component and a pseudo-device module.
