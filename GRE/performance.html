<h2>Supplemental Materials to Graphine Paper</h2>
  <br>
  <p>GRE was recently renamed as Graphine whose details can be found in our tech-report "Graphine: Programming Graph-Parallel Computation of Large Natural Graphs on Multicore Cluster". In this section, we complement some performance analysis that was not included in the report. In Graphine, the runtime can be divided into three parts--local computing (local scatter/combine, init, and apply), remote computing (remote scatter/combine and related communication) and other overhead (schedule cost and idle time for load imbalance). </p>
  <h3>Breakdown of Runtime</h3>
  <p> We first give a brief analysis to Graphine's runtime breakdown in percentage. Specifically, we consider PageRank and Single Source Shortest Path on 2~16 nodes and the Twitter (with 41M vertices and 1.46B edges) graph. The results are shown in the following figures.</p>

</div>
  <div style="clear: both;">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>By investigating the results, we have the following observations. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Compared to Graphine+Oblv. that partitions graph in parallel, Graphine+Cord. that uses serial graph partitioning strategy has higher rate of local computing time than Graphine+Oblv., due to the reduction of resulting communication.</li>
      <li>Compared to SSSP, PageRank has higher rate of local computing time and much less cost on &quot;other&quot; overhead. This phenomenon is also intuitive just as we can expect. PageRank consists of a series of iterative procedures in which each vertex and edge participates computation, and thus its computation and communication are statically determined by the graph partitioning reulsts. Since we implement balanced partition, PageRank has no redundant communication and almost no overhead on runtime load imbalance . To the contrast, our SSSP is a label-correcting algorithm in which some vertex computations are speculative, leading to redundant computation and resulting communication as well as runtime load imbalance.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <h3>Rate of Local Compute Time</h3>
  <p>The Rate of local compute time is the key factor for Graphine's scalability. Since the remote computing performance is strongly decided by the communication efficiency and thus typically can't scale as well as local computing performance, a high rate of local computing time is crirical for Graphine's overall scalability.</p>
  <p>Here we present the rate of local compute time in experiements of three basic graph-parallel algorithms (i.e., PageRank, Single Source Shortest Path and Connected Components) on 2~16 nodes. As shown in the following (a)~(d) four figures, Graphine shows high rate of local computing time. Specifically, with less than 8 nodes, the rate of local computing time keeps &gt;60%. From 8 to 16 nodes, the rate of local computing time has an obvious drop. This is partly because when number of nodes is more than 8, their communication concerns inter-cabinet connection which has lower performance than intra-cabinet network.</p>

    <p>Also, in the following Figure(e) we present the rate of local compute time in experiments of the three basic agorithms on fixed 16 machines and increasing graph scales. As shown, the values lie between 45% ~ 70%.</p>

     <h3>Communication</h3>
    
    <p>The following four figures show the data volume of communication in the Graphine experiements.</p>

 <div style="clear: both;"> </div>
 <p>
 <p>Besides, to understant the relation between graph partitioning and real commuication, we further investigate the amortized communication volume on each agent. The results are shown in the following four figures. 
 <ol>
 <li>In PageRank (Figures (a) and (b)), the amortized communication per agent is constant(with a slight deviation that is introduced by the overhead of our one-sided communication implemetation, for more details see our Graphine paper) for different graph paritions. This is because in PageRank, the communication is pre-determined, i.e., one agent means one communication operation. </li>
 
 <li>In SSSP (Figure(c)) and Connected Components (Figure(c)), as a contrast, the amortized communication per agent varies with different number of macines (graph partitions). Unlike in PageRank, during the lifetime of execution in SSSP and Connected Components, vertices are dynamically activated and deactived, leading to dynamic communication on agents. Besides, we can see that the amortized communication per agent also shows an obvious upward trend. Until now, we are still doing some work on understanding whether and how the  graph partitioning results relate to the above upward trend of communication per agent.</li>
